### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I feel like the topics discussed in the labs perfectly helped me prepare for any technicalities with the project. 
I think one thing that can help however, would be a lab or activity that would teach us how to plan the project in terms of layout & in terms of code structure. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would like to:
- introduce smooth animations when you click on a movie. 
- add a footer with some links to my personal GitHub
- Add better styling and fonts
- Restructor the layout of the Movie Popup page


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

- One of my peers implemented a feature where the page would automaticallly bring up search results as the user types into the search bar. I would like to add this feature.
- I think my project went just as planned and is in a very satisfactory state.I liked that I was able to get the APIs to work properly and can now understand how API keys endpoints work.
